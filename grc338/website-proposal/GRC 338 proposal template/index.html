            <p>
                Our target audience focuses on Millennials and Generation Z. We are looking at local students and young professionals with a soft spot for stationary whether it is for day to day working or fun hobbies. This site can be used

            <p>
                Our target audience’s primary goals are to purchase unique and high-quality pieces of stationary for themselves and/or others. They constantly seek new and fresh designs to enhance their experience in school, work or their
                hobbies.
